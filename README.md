# Color-Replacement-using-OpenCV
This project demonstrates how to identify and modify a specific color in real-time using OpenCV.
🎨 Color Detection and Replacement using OpenCV
📘 Project Overview

This mini project focuses on detecting and modifying a specific color in images or live video streams using OpenCV. It leverages the power of computer vision to isolate a target color range, create a mask, and replace that color dynamically with another — enabling visually appealing transformations and effects.

This concept is inspired by the green screen (chroma key) technique widely used in movie production, video editing, and visual effects, where a particular background color (often green or blue) is replaced with another image or scene.
